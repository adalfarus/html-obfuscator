# HTML Obfuscator

Simple python tool to help you obfuscate/de-obfuscate your HTML code quickly. Obfuscated html will run without needing to be de-obfuscated.

Usage:
```tool.py [obf|deobf] [filename.html] [filename2.html] ...```

Also note that files de-obfuscated with this tool MUST have been obfuscated with it as well.
